## 2026-01 status
High-level summary aligned to the Month 1 plan (foundations + determinism contract). This month focused on the platform skeleton and a first vertical slice that proves “workflow -> manifest + event log” end-to-end.

Platform skeleton and test harness
We set up the .NET solution with an API project and a test project, plus baseline wiring for controllers and OpenAPI exposure. The test project includes smoke and golden-test placeholders to anchor the planned replay harness later in the year. This establishes the foundation to grow deterministic and replayable testing without committing to the final harness shape yet.

Manifest + event log schemas (draft)
We drafted the manifest model and event log schema/entry models to encode the determinism contract inputs (seed, time source, model/tool refs, policy decisions) and the log structure (event type, payload, timestamp). These are intentionally minimal and versioned so we can harden the schema across Month 2–3 without breaking early integration points.

First vertical slice: “hello workflow”
We replaced the template WeatherForecast endpoint with a POST `/workflow/hello` controller action that generates a run id, creates a manifest using the draft schema, and writes a single event log entry. This satisfies the Month 1 DoD: a callable workflow that emits both a manifest and a log.

Observability baseline
Serilog console logging and OpenTelemetry tracing (OTLP exporter) are wired. This is intentionally lightweight but sets up the core signals we’ll need for later determinism debugging and performance baselining.

Local developer UX
OpenAPI, Swagger UI, and Scalar API reference are configured for local visibility of endpoints, keeping iteration tight as the deterministic engine and log schemas evolve.
