## 2026-02 status
High-level TODO list for 2026-02, including carryover items that are still missing from the 2026-01 plan and the planned 2026-02 work.

2026-02 update (DONE)
Implemented Chunk 1 determinism core hooks:
- Added seed-locking interfaces/implementation (run-scoped locked seed provider).
- Added time-source record/replay hooks (recording and replay time sources + time-source metadata descriptor).
- Wired workflow manifest seed/time fields to injected services instead of controller placeholders.
- Added tests for seed-locking and time record/replay hooks (6 new tests; suite passing at 11 total).

2026-02 update (DONE)
Implemented Chunk 2 golden replay harness baseline:
- Extracted hello workflow artifact creation into a reusable service used by the controller and tests.
- Added checked-in golden fixtures for hello workflow (`manifest.json` + `eventlog.jsonl`).
- Replaced placeholder golden test with real record/replay tests against golden artifacts.
- Replay validation compares event log bytes and manifest deterministic fields (time source mode differs in replay).
- Test suite now passes with 12 total tests.

2026-02 update (DONE)
Implemented Chunk 3 config-driven workflow values:
- Added `HelloWorkflow` configuration section (models, tools, policy decisions) in app settings.
- Wired `HelloWorkflowService` to resolve manifest model/tool/policy entries from configuration instead of hardcoded placeholders.
- Added config validation for required fields and non-empty configured lists.
- Added tests verifying config-to-manifest mapping, ordering preservation (deterministic list order), and invalid config rejection.
- Test suite now passes with 15 total tests.

2026-02 update (DONE)
Implemented Chunk 4 replay CLI skeleton:
- Added `Aos.ReplayCli` console project with a reusable `ReplayCliRunner`.
- CLI accepts `--manifest` and `--eventlog` paths, loads and validates inputs, and replays the hello workflow using `ReplayTimeSource`.
- CLI compares deterministic manifest fields and event log bytes, returning success/failure exit codes.
- Added CLI tests for success, mismatch, missing file, and invalid manifest handling.
- Test suite now passes with 19 total tests.

2026-01 carryover (DEFERRED / out of scope for Feb close)
CI pipeline wiring for tests and formatting (optional). Intentionally deferred (not planned for current workflow).

2026-01 carryover (DONE / refined in Feb)
Determinism contract manifest fields were advanced in February (seed/time semantics, replay hooks, and config-driven model/tool/policy values). Further schema hardening can continue in later months.

2026-02 plan (DONE)
Seed-locking and time-source injection with record/replay hooks.

2026-02 plan (DONE)
Implement a real golden test harness that replays manifests/logs and compares deterministic output.

2026-02 plan (DONE)
Replace placeholder policies/tools/models with real config-driven values.

2026-02 plan (DONE)
Deterministic log/manifest replay CLI (if we want tooling before Month 3).
