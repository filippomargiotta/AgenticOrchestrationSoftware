TODO
- Formalize the determinism contract fields in the manifest (currently placeholders for time/seed semantics).
- Implement a real golden test harness that replays manifests/logs and compares deterministic output.
- Optional: CI pipeline wiring for tests and formatting.
- Seed-locking and time-source injection with record/replay hooks.
- Deterministic log/manifest replay CLI.
- Replace placeholder policies/tools/models with real config-driven values.
