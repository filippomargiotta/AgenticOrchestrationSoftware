## 2026-02 status
High-level TODO list for 2026-02, including carryover items that are still missing from the 2026-01 plan and the planned 2026-02 work.

2026-02 update (DONE)
Implemented Chunk 1 determinism core hooks:
- Added seed-locking interfaces/implementation (run-scoped locked seed provider).
- Added time-source record/replay hooks (recording and replay time sources + time-source metadata descriptor).
- Wired workflow manifest seed/time fields to injected services instead of controller placeholders.
- Added tests for seed-locking and time record/replay hooks (6 new tests; suite passing at 11 total).

2026-01 carryover (TODO)
CI pipeline wiring for tests and formatting (optional).

2026-01 carryover (TODO)
Formalize the determinism contract fields in the manifest (currently placeholders for time/seed semantics).

2026-02 plan (DONE)
Seed-locking and time-source injection with record/replay hooks.

2026-02 plan (TODO)
Implement a real golden test harness that replays manifests/logs and compares deterministic output.

2026-02 plan (TODO)
Replace placeholder policies/tools/models with real config-driven values.

2026-02 plan (TODO)
Deterministic log/manifest replay CLI (if we want tooling before Month 3).
